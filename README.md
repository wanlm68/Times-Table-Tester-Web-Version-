Maths Times Table Tester (Full version)

Web app to test times tables knowledge, uses html, css and javascript.
Created for my kids to aid learning during covid-19 lockdown

Currently 2 modes exist:

1, Free practice, user can choose which table to practice via a dropdown (times tables 2 to 12 or 'All' for random selection).
2, Timed test (currently fixed at 3 minutes)

A score is given on completion of the timed test which is stored along with other result details in a IndexedDB database, this allows the accumulated score to show in a progress bar.
